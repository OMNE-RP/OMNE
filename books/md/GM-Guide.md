# GM Guide <a name="gm_guide"></a>

For the sake of brevity, and in the name of this being the very first version of this guide, we're going to make a few assumptions.

First, that you've run a game before, in any system. This is a big one, and if you haven't, you might want to cut your teeth on a more fleshed out system such as [D&D 4e](http://dnd4.wikia.com/wiki/D%26D4_Wiki) or [Risus](http://www222.pair.com/sjohn/risus.htm). Or just dive right into OMNE; we're not your real mom.

Second, that you have a predilection toward creating fantasy worlds. This is pretty important because nearly all of the content enclosed in this guide is for the creation of the world in which your game will be set. In OMNE, unlike D&D, world-building often a critical part of being a GM.

Third, that you can read. Otherwise, this is probably unhelpful.

Fourth and finally, that you've read at least the intro of the [Core Rulebook](./Core-Rulebook.md), which gives you a basic tour of the OMNE system.

## Building Worlds <a name="building_worlds"></a>
Worlds, in OMNE, represent the environment in which a game may be played. A world includes all of the content necessary for gameplay, including geography, municipalities, noteworthy individual, lore, history, cuisine, bowling leagues, etc. As the GM, the level to which this content is explicitly defined or improvised is entirely up to you. You can create Tolkienesque tomes or make everything up as you go along. Chances are it will be a mixture of the two, but however you approach this, there are at least three categories of entities that need documented: Creatures, Items, and Rituals.

[Creatures](#creating_creatures), [Items](#instantiating_items), and [Rituals](#defining_rituals) are all needed for your players to be able to create and play their characters. In fact,  they may very well be [waiting on you to finish reading this](./Core-Rulebook.md#gm_creatures), so you might want to move it along.
